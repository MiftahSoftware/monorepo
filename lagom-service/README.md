# devops-workshop

Following is your problem statement from the eyes of a client.  

I want  Kubernetes cluster running over a cloud (AWS or Gcloud, whichever is cost and performance efficient) over which my infrastructure would be running. The components of my infra are 2 microservices, a message queue based inter-service communication channel. A cache for my one microservice and a NoSQL DB for persistence. 

The source code of my application is ready and could be picked at below-mentioned links, make any necessary changes in code base if required:   

https://github.com/KnoldusLabs/premonr/tree/master/akka-http-service 
https://github.com/KnoldusLabs/premonr/tree/master/lagom-services/employee-details    

I also want proper CI/CD in place and look for an end to end automation i.e. from infra creation to end deployment and a provision to monitor all my components.  

Kindly select an appropriate tech stack to facilitate your client's requirement and be optimal in your decisions. 

Follow agile practices and try to deliver at the end of each day. This activity must be conducted by each of you in silos with no discussion among peers, your only contact point must be mentors. The time allotted by your client is 3 days and the last day of submission is 11.July.2019 @ 11:AM.
